The insertionSort() function takes an array as input and returns a sorted array.
The function loops through the array from index 1 to the end.
For each element in the loop, the function sets current to the current element.
The function then loops through the elements from 0 to i - 1, comparing current to each element.
If current is less than the current element, the function swaps the two elements.
The function then increments i by 1 and repeats the loop.
The function returns the sorted array.# Sorting-and-Searching-Algorithm
